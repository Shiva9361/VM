## Module 2
- Implemented a minimal VM with the following features
  - Arithmetic Instructions
  - Comparison Instructions
  - Jump Instructions
  - Memory Instructions
  - Function calling (including stack support)
  - Class Meta data loading
  - binary file loading into memory
  - Execution of subset of instructions till function calling
  - CMake for compilation of the project
  - Test files for current implementation
